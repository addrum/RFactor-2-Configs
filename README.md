# Tips

## AI Only Picking Same Vehicle
Ensure all/multiple filters are selected when launching the server.
If a car has lots of teams, remove some of them so the AI are forced to pick a different car with an available team. 
e.g. if there's 10 cars available for a Ferrari GTE, only select 4 of them so when those 4 are taken by AI, the AI will move onto a different car.

## Paid Content Not Installing on Server (Mod Manager)
Copy the ServerUnlock.bin from the client to the server after running the client once after each new purchase.

## Paid Content Install/Updates
To be able to install paid content or see updates for installed paid content in Mod Manager, you'll need to regenerate the ServerUnlock file and copy back to the server (may or may not need to recopy the ServerKeys file to the client machine first).
